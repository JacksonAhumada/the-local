## Description

The following project is a database of curated lists of restaurants, attractions, and entertainment for a city created by travellers and locals. Users will be able to login and create their own curated list or view lists created by other users for the city they search for.

The motivation for this project is to create an application to assist tourist and locals in maximizing their positive travel, food and entertainment experiences and prevent missed opportunities or the waste of precious time and money.

### User Story:

```
AS a travel enthusiast and lover of food and all things entertaining
I want to be able to share my great finds along with their WOW FACTOR OR SECRETS/TIPS with fellow travellers.
I also want others to be able to share their local favorites or great new finds with me.
I want locals and travellers to be able to create their own curated list of great food, attractions and entertainment for each city visited.
I want locals and travellers to be able to view the available lists for a city.
SO that we all can avoid tourist traps and experience what makes that city truly great!
